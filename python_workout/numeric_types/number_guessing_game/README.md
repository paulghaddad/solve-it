For this exercise:

Write a program that chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
Then ask the user to guess what number has been chosen.
Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of:

* Too high
* Too low
* Just right

If the user guessed correctly, then the program exits. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.
The program only exits after the user guesses correctly.
