The biggest concern on whether to realloc or not after a deletion is how
frequent deletions will be compared to insertions, and their respective timing.

In the case where we have relatively random orderings of insertions and
deletions, holes created by deleted items will subsequently be filled by new
elements. The case where this breaks down is if we have a large number of
insertions followed by a number of deletions, but no further insertions. Then
we could potentially have a large number of holes that will never be filled.

In most cases, deletions without reallocating memory would seem to be okay.
